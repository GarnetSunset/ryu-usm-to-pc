PS5 USMs are in VP9/HCA format, with a REALLY awful 5.1 surround sound layout, that's completely incorrect.
(PS5 Cutscenes are also in 4K/60FPS, vs 1080p/30 which shipped on steam)

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO THIS RGG, WHY DIDN'T YOU BAKE VP9 SUPPORT INTO THE PC PORT??? PLEASE FIX THIS SERIOUSLY. THE CUTSCENES ARE SMALLER ON PS5 DESPITE BEING HIGHER QUALITY.

CH1 - FL
CH2 - FR
CH3 - BL
CH4 - BR
CH5 - FC
CH6 - Low Freq
```

That's the layout that Lost Judgment uses. It's not standard.
